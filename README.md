# LeetCode to GitHub Service

This project automates the process of fetching your LeetCode submissions and uploading them directly to a GitHub repository. It leverages Python, `leetcode-cli`, and `requests` to interact with the LeetCode API and uses the GitHub API to push solutions to your repository. The service can be scheduled to run periodically using `APScheduler`, ensuring your GitHub repository is always up-to-date with your latest solutions.

## Features
- Automated Fetching: Fetches your LeetCode submissions automatically.
- Automated Uploading: Pushes solutions directly to a GitHub repository.
- Periodic Execution: Runs periodically to ensure your GitHub repository stays up-to-date.
- Modular Design: Structured into reusable classes and methods for maintainability.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A GitHub account with a Personal Access Token that has `repo` permissions.
- A LeetCode account with valid credentials.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local system:

cd leetcode-solutions


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

python -m venv leetcode_service_env


### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
- Windows:
  
  leetcode_service_env\Scripts\activate
  
- macOS/Linux:
  
  source leetcode_service_env/bin/activate
  

### 4. Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, create it with the following dependencies:

requests
leetcode-cli
apscheduler


### 5. Configure Your Credentials
Create a `config.json` file in the root of the repository with the following structure:
json
{
    "github_username": "your-github-username",
    "github_token": "your-github-token",
    "leetcode_username": "your-leetcode-username",
    "leetcode_password": "your-leetcode-password",
    "github_repo": "your-github-repo-name"
}

- GitHub Token: Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub with `repo` permissions. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.3/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) if you need help.
- Make sure to add `config.json` to your `.gitignore` to keep your credentials safe.

## Usage

### Run the Service Manually
You can run the service manually to fetch and upload your LeetCode solutions:

python service.py


### Schedule the Service to Run Periodically
The service uses `APScheduler` to schedule the job. By default, it is set to run every 24 hours. You can start the scheduled service with:

python service.py


### Alternatively, Set Up a Cron Job
If you prefer using a cron job for scheduling:
1. Open your crontab file:
   
   crontab -e
   
2. Add the following line to run the script daily:
   
   0 0 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/repo/service.py
   

## File Structure


.
├── config.json               # Configuration file for credentials (do not commit this to Git)
├── requirements.txt          # Dependencies for the project
├── config.py                 # Configuration class
├── leetcode_service.py       # LeetCode service class
├── github_service.py         # GitHub service class
├── orchestrator.py           # Orchestrator and entry point for the service
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
└── .gitignore                # Git ignore file


### Overview of Files:
- `config.json`: Contains all necessary credentials for interacting with GitHub and LeetCode. Ensure it is not committed to the repository.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies for the project.
- `service.py`: Contains the main codebase and logic for the service.
- `.gitignore`: Ensures sensitive files and unnecessary files (e.g., virtual environment) are not committed.

## Modules Overview

### 1. `Config`
- Loads and stores credentials from `config.json`.

### 2. `LeetCodeService`
- Manages authentication with LeetCode and fetches user submissions using the API.

### 3. `GitHubService`
- Saves solutions as files and pushes them to the specified GitHub repository.

### 4. `LeetCodeToGitHub`
- Orchestrates the entire process: logging into LeetCode, fetching solutions, saving them, and pushing to GitHub.


## Security Considerations
- Ensure `config.json` is added to `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being pushed to GitHub.
- Use environment variables for credentials if deploying to a production environment.
